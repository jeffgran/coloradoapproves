  <h2>How to Help</h2>

  <h4>What exactly are we seeking?</h4>

  <p>Representative Jonathan Singer will be introducing a bill into the Colorado State General Assembly. We seek to help that bill get passed. The bill's text can be seen <a href="http://bill.av4co.org">here</a>. The bill will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>modify the Colorado Revised Statues, adding Approval Voting to the list of valid election rules</li>
    <li>ask that the Colorado Secratary of State (currently Wayne Williams) create rules and procedures for the use of Approval Voting before the end of November, 2017.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The bill does not mandate any use of Approval Voting. It simply makes it possible for local communities to choose to use Approval Voting if they desire. We want a chance to prove on a small scale that this works and is a better way of voting. There's no downside to this for the State, as nothing is mandated and there's virtually no financial impact.</p>

  <h4>What can I do to help?</h4>
  <p>
    Since our current goal is to pass a bill in the state legislature, the best thing you can do to help is <strong>help convince the legislators to pass the bill</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best way to do that is to contact your two representatives and ask them to support the bill on your behalf. Remember, they work for you. Their job is to represent you. So enough of us tell them that we want them to support this bill, they will have no choice but to listen. Many of them aren't even aware of this issue. If they hear your support, they will take it seriously, look at the bill and realize that there is nothing to lose by passing it.

<h2>How to Contact your State Legislators</h2>

<p>So with that in mind, we've created a tool (below) to make it easy for your to find and contact your legislators.</p>

<ul class="nav nav-tabs nav-justified" role="tablist" id="step-nav-tabs">
  <li id="tab-step1" role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#tab-step1-content" aria-controls="tab-step1-content" role="tab" >Step 1: Find your Legislators</a></li>
  <li id="tab-step2" class="disabled" role="presentation"><a href="#tab-step2-content" aria-controls="tab-step2-content" role="tab" >Step 2: Contact your Legislators</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="tab-content">
  <div role="tabpanel" class="panel tab-pane fade in active" id="tab-step1-content">

    <h3>Step 1: Find your Legislators</h3>

    <p>You have two, a House Representative and a Senator. Enter your address below and we'll tell you who they are. Don't worry, your address will not be saved.</p>

    <div id="error" class="alert alert-warning" style="display:none">
      There was an error retreiving the information for that address. Please double-check the address and try again.
    </div>

    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="address-autocomplete">Home Address</label>
      <input id="address-autocomplete" placeholder="123 Colfax" class="form-control" onFocus="geolocate()" type="text"></input>
      <p class="help-block">Start typing to show matching addresses. Select yours to show your customized information.</p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <div role="tabpanel" class="panel tab-pane fade" id="tab-step2-content">

    <div id="contact-step-2">
      <h3>Step 2: Contact your Legislators</h3>

      <p>
        Below are your two Colorado State legislators, one for the House of Representatives, and one for the Senate.
      </p>

      <div id="rep1"></div>
      <div id="rep2"></div>

      <h4>Which contact method is best?</h4>
      <p>
        Anything is better than nothing! But some communication channels are more effective than others. Phone and physical letters mailed through snail-mail are best. Emails and other digital forms of communication can work if they get through, but have a higher chance of getting lost in the noise.
      </p>

      <h4>What should I say?</h4>
      <p>
        You can keep your message short, especially if it's a phone call. We don't want to waste anyone's time, we just want to make our support known.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example of what you might say:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Hi this is (name) and I live at XYZ in your district. I wanted to ask you to support a bill from Representative Jonathan Singer that will introduce Approval Voting to Colorado. Approval Voting is a voting method that will help make our elections more fair. You can find out more at coloradoapproves.org or av4co.org. If you like the idea, Rep Singer also needs more co sponsors for the bill. Thanks.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Here a couple of example letters that you can use as inspiration or copy and paste into an email:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="/senatorletterexample/">Example Letter #1</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="/representativeletterexample/">Example Letter #2</a></li>

      </ul>
