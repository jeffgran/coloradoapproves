# Example Letter to your Representative

Dear Representative ______________

I am a citizen in your district working to promote a reform in Colorado called Approval Voting. Approval Voting is simple, it just means that you can vote for more than one candidate in an election.

Rep. Johnathan Singer of district 11 has introduced a bill that will allow Approval Voting to be used by local governments for nonpartisan elections. The bill's latest draft is here: http://bill.av4co.org/

Surely you've been in a race, or heard about a race where a third candidate threatened to "spoil" an election by "splitting the vote". Approval Voting solves that problem by allowing voters to vote for both their fringe candidate AND their realistic candidate, making our elections more fair, and giving more voice to the people.

This is about improving our democracy. Governor Hickenlooper said in his State of the State address that the states are the "laboratories of democracy," and that Colorado should lead the way.  Won't you take this opportunity to help put that idea into action?

Rep. Singer's bill does not force anyone to anything. It simply allows local and nonpartisan elections to be conducted with Approval Voting so we can show on a small scale that it works.

Please, I urge you to do anything in your power to help this bill get passed.

This is not a fringe issue. The issue of voting methods is a national issue. Maine just became the first state to pass a state-wide measure for alternative voting methods. There are grassroots groups all across the nation working to do the same thing in many other states. Colorado has a chance to lead the way. Please help us do it.
