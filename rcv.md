## Why Approval Voting instead of Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)?

So you've heard about Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) and you're wondering why we're not supporting that instead of Approval Voting? Or maybe you're just curious? I was in the same place a few months ago. Since then, I've spent a lot of time educating myself. This is what I've learned, and why I'm supporting Approval Voting for Colorado. My intention is to be as unbiased as possible, while explaining why I thinkg Approval is the better choice. You may choose differently, and that's fine. Either way, we are both fighting for the same goal: fixing our broken voting rules.

Buckle up, and get some coffee. This is going to go deep.


## First things first

First of all, let's be clear. RCV is a significant improvement over our broken Plurality system. So I'm not **against** RCV. If we were using approval voting to vote for a system, I'd approve of RCV.

Second of all, the reform we are fighting for is not in conflict with RCV. In 2008, the Colorado state congress passed [HB 08-1378, AKA the Voter Choice Act](http://votesmart.org/billtext/19092.pdf), revised the state statutes to permit cities and towns to use instant run-off voting (AKA RCV), which it refers to as "ranked voting." Since then, three cities in Colorado have decided to use RCV for their elections (Telluride, Basalt, and Aspen). One has had a successful election (Telluride), one has never had more than two candidates, so never needed to use it (Basalt), and one has repealed it after a controversial election (Aspen)[footnote].

The Colorado State Statues have a section where all of the recognized election rules are enumerated. The Voter Choice Act added one to the list. The only thing our bill (which doesn't have a name yet since it hasn't been introduced yet) does is to add yet another valid election rule to the list. So in that sense, all we seek is that Approval Voting be legitimized alongside other valid voting methods.


## Practical Reasons

### We already have RCV in Colorado

As stated above Colorado already has RCV, but has had limited interest/success with it. Since election day 2016, there has been a nation-wide resurgance of interest in replacing Plurality with superior voting systems, so maybe that will change.

### Simple Ballots

With Approval Voting, the ballot doesn't even have to change. The only difference is the wording. Where it says, "vote for one," it would change to say, "vote for one or more."

### Same Voting Machines

The voting machines don't have to change either. The 64 Colorado counties [are currently in the process of replacing all of their voting machines](http://www.coloradoindependent.com/156916/colorados-new-voting-machine-mandates-irk-cash-strapped-counties) in order to comply with a 2009 law. There is already controversy coming from the county clerks about the cost of this. Imagine if we tried to tell them they'd have to replace them all AGAIN a year later, in order to support RCV. They'd fight tooth and nail against it, especially given the [disastrous RCV election that happened in Aspen](http://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspens-instant-runoff-voting-quick-but-confusing/).

The Voting Machine issue may seem minor but the cost difference is **not** negligible. It is immense. Financial analysis shows that switching to Approval Voting would most likely **lower** the cost of an election[footnote], while RCV would require anywhere from 10s of thousands to millions of dollars in added cost, depending on the size of the electorate and whether the votes are being hand-counted or machine-counted.

### Simpler to explain

With Approval Voting, you can now vote for more than one. Most votes still wins. That's it! Try explaining RCV to someone not familiar with voting theory. It's not impossible, and "difficult" is a relative term... but relatively, it's undeniably more difficult to explain than Appoval Voting is.

### No Downside

Since our current goal is simply to allow Approval Voting, not to mandate it, there is no downside to passing this bill. In the name of freedom, we should allow municipalities who want to have more fair elections by using Approval Voting to use it.


## Mathematical Reasons

### Spoiler Effect

The "spoiler effect" is one of the two biggest problems with our curent Plurality voting system. And RCV does not solve the spoiler effect. It reduces it, and hides the rest behind the complicated counting process. This is difficult to explain or to understand, but luckily there is a video produced by the Center for Election Science that shows it very clearly:

  </div>
</div>


As I said above, RCV **does** reduce the spoiler effect. That's a good thing. Out of the hundreds of RCV elections that have been held in America, only a handful have been spoiled by the spoiler effect. But some of the voters who did fall victim to it disliked this spoiler effect so much that they repealed it. This happened in Aspen, CO and Burlington, VT, among others.

### Rebuttal

RCV advocates will respond to this by saying that Aspen used an unproven variant of RCV, and that's true. They will respond that the repeal in Burlington was because of voter backlash against the candidate, and they erroneously directed their hatred of the candidate at the system that elected him. I find that to be a weak argument -- [the mathematics prove](http://rangevoting.org/Burlington.html) that the wrong candidate was elected by the system, and that voters who were mislead by the RCV slogan, "You can vote for the candidate you like the best without worrying that you'll help elect the candidate you like the least," witnessed firsthand the falsehood of that statement. It may be that we never know the true reason why Burlington repealed RCV, I but I think it's unfair to say that the "spoiler effect" was not part of it.


## Philosophical Reasons

### Third Parties

Proponents of RCV often talk about third party candidates. RCV does not help third party candidates get elected. This is widely accepted because it has been proven by looking at [existing RCV elections over the last 100+ years](http://rangevoting.org/AustralianPol.html).

So how does RCV help third parties? Well, the idea is that even though they won't get elected (and even though if they get close, they will cause a spoiler effect, see above), they will get enough support to "move the political center," meaning that the two major parties would be forced to absorb the ideas and policies of the third party so that they can get enough "second choice" votes from the third party voters.

That may be appealing to you. But if you're a member of a third party or are one of the [57% of Americans who think we need a strong third party](http://www.gallup.com/poll/195920/americans-desire-third-party-persists-election-year.aspx), I doubt that vision appeals to you. We want to end the two-party "duopoly" on our politics, not subtly manipulate the duopoly to give campaign lipservice to our issues.


### Consensus Candidates

In theory, Approval Voting will tend to elect the more "consensus" candidate rather than extremist candidates. This is also true of RCV but in a different way. Under RCV, if one candidate has 51% first choice votes in the first round, that candidate is immediately elected. But what if 100% of the people had a different candidate as their second choice?

This argument is under the "philosophical" heading because your philosophy of who should be our leader might be different than mine. I think the hypothetical 100% second choice should win instead of the 51% first choice, because that consensus choice is more paletable to all. The 51% favorite would likely be a more extreme, divisive candidate, causing more unrest. If you disagree, and think that first choices are more important than second choices, this argument isn't for you.


### Vote for Issues

Theoretically, Approval Voting would let you effectively cast your vote for issues, instead of for candidates. You could decide what your most important issues are, and find all the candidates that agree with you, and vote for all of them. Then, you're ensureing that you've done all you can to make sure your view on those issues are heard. Under RCV you still really only get to vote for one candidate at a time.

### All Votes Counted

Since the spoiler effect would be gone, we could expect to see more candidates on the ballot, and even in 2016, under Plurality, there were 7 candidates in the Colorado Senate race. I didn't bother to research any but the Republican and the Democrat for my vote... did you? But under Approval it would make sense to look at all of them and vote for all of the ones that you agree with, giving a major boost in likelihood that one of the others would get elected. Under RCV, your second and third choices are not counted unless your first choice gets eliminated. That can distort the final numbers to make it seem like a landslide win, when many votes were not counted. And that can lead to bizarre circumstances (see the Mathematical reasons above).




## RCV Advocates' arguments in favor of RCV

### "You can always vote for your favorite without worrying that you will help elect your least favorite"

This is false. See the **Mathematical Reasons** heading above. How do RCV advocates respond? By saying that while counter-examples to that statement are theoretically possible, they are exceedingly rare, and that when they happen it doesn't matter.

### "It's a winnable reform"

This is true. RCV has been enacted in multiple cities and now in the state of Maine. It's true that that gives it a sense of legitimacy, and that there are real-world results to show that it works in practice. But I find this to be a weak argument against trying an even simpler and in some ways better system: Approval Voting.
