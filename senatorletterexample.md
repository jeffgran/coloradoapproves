# Example Letter to your Senator

Dear Senator ________,

I am your constituent, and I am writing to express my support for an upcoming bill sponsored by Representative Singer (HD11) and Senator Kefalas (SD14) to allow the use of Approval Voting in local non-partisan elections in Colorado, and to ask you to support this bill on my behalf.

Approval Voting is a simple reform: we allow voters to vote for more than one candidate on their ballot, if they choose. The most votes still wins. Nothing else about the ballot changes besides the instructions, and nothing about the election rules changes.

But this simple change has an extremely positive effect on our democracy. Surely you've been in a 3-way race, or witnessed a 3-way race where there was risk of the "spoiler effect" -- two similar candidates "split" the vote, resulting in the other, third candidate winning. This is anti-democratic, because it means that one "side" of the political spectrum got more votes, but because of the limitation that voters can only choose one, the wrong side won. Approval Voting is a simple way to fix this. A voter can vote their conscience, for their favorite "fringe candidate", and ALSO vote for their favorite of the two frontrunner candidates, resulting in the proper winner.

This bill only asks that the Secretary of State provide rules so that local communities can try this method, to see if the promises of its superiority bear out. I am confident that it will, we just need to give it a chance.

In the State of the State address, Governor Hickenlooper said multiple times that, "the states are the laboratories of democracy." I urge you to support this bill so that we can have a chance to put this into the laboratory and prove that this is the way forward for our state and our country. There is no risk in this bill -- there's virtually no financial cost associated, and it doesn't mandate that anyone do anything. It just allows communities to use Approval Voting if they choose to.

Lots more information is available on the benefits of Approval Voting, and our citizen effort to get this reform started:
