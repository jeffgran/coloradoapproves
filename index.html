          <p class="intro">Imagine three people are sitting around, and they're hungry. They decide to order a pizza to share.</p>

          <p class="intro">Out of the three people, two love pineapple pizza, but also like pepperoni. One person loves pepperoni, likes  plain cheese, but hates pineapple.</p>

          <p class="intro">Which pizza should they get? How would you choose?</p>

          <p class="intro">If you're like most people, you'd choose pepperoni. That's because it was the "consensus" choice. Everyone would be happy that way.</p>

          <h2>Tyranny of the Majority</h2>

          <p>But if you were to hold an election the way the United States runs our elections, what would happen?</p>

          <p>Everyone votes for their favorite. Two votes for pineapple, one for Pepperoni. That third person is outnumbered and so, she is overruled. This is called the "tyranny of the majority."</p>

          <h2>Tyranny of the Minority</h2>

          <p>But in reality it's even worse. Think about the last election results you remember seeing. Who won? What percentage of the results did he or she get? I'll bet you a dollar it was less than 50%. That means it's the same as the pizza situation above, but <em>less than half</em> of the people wanted pineapple, and they <em>still</em> overruled the rest of the people. That's like having 4 people out of 10 forcing the rest to eat a weird pineapple pizza. Even if you like pineapple pizza, you have to admit that's kinda rude.</p>

          <p>I like to call this the "tyranny of the minority." A minority of the people in a given electorate effectively overrule the majority, in most cases.</p>

          <p>Luckily, there is a very simple way to fix this problem. It's called "Approval Voting," and you already intuitively do it in your head every day. Let's go back to the three people ordering pizza. How would we hold an election that would select pepperoni? Easy, we let people like as many kinds of pizza as they actually like. It's weird to even type that sentence, but in our bizzare American election system, it has to be said. People can like more than one thing at a time! Three people (all of them) like pepperoni, two people like pineapple, and one person likes cheese. Three is more than two or one, so pepperoni wins.</p>

          <p>In our elections, we usually only see a Democrat and a Republican on the ballot. The reason: the error of our election process, called Plurality Voting -- a Plurality just means picking the candidate that got the most votes, which is usually less than 50%.</p>

          <p>You might be thinking that since most elections have something like 45% for the Democrat and 48% for Republican candidate (or vice versa), that it doesn't matter because only a very small percentage of people are being overruled. You are wrong, if you do.</p>

          <p>Think about this: 40% of Americans are registered as "Independent" or some third party like Green, Libertarian, etc. That's compared to 30% Republican and 30% Democrat! The non-Democrat, non-Republicans easily outnumber the Democrats or the Republicans. But they have virtually no representation. They are the Pepperoni-lovers of the world, and the Pineapple-lovers are forcing them to vote for pineapple with ham, or pineapple without ham, or else "throw their vote away" on a third party or independent candidate.</p>

          <p>This has to end. America is supposed to be the greatest nation in the world. We put a man on the moon. We invented the transistor and the internet. We are using the absolute worst voting system for all of our elections. Really! According to a very meta "vote of voting systems," by a bunch of Ph.D. voting theory experts at the London School of Economics and Political Science, our Plurality system ranks dead last. There are a whole slew of better ways to vote, each of them having some pros and cons involving ballot complexity and a variety of mathematical properties with names like the "favorite betrayal criterion," and the "later no harm criterion." In a way, it doesn't even matter which one we choose instead because literally any of them are better than using the mathematically proven worst.</p>

          <h2>The Colorado Movement</h2>

          <p>Here in Colorado, there is already a small but growing movement to fix this problem. Representative Jonathan Singer will be introducing a bill into the Colorado General Assembly in January to allow Coloradans to use Approval Voting in local elections. It doesn't force anyone to do anything, it just says that any city can use the Approval system if they want to.</p>
