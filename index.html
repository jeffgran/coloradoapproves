      <h2>A Pizza Election</h2>

      <p>But what if you were to hold a <strong>pizza election</strong> to decide? If you ran it the way the United States runs our elections, what would happen?</p>

      <p>Everyone would vote for their favorite:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Two</strong> votes for <strong>pineapple</strong></li>
        <li><strong>One</strong> vote for <strong>pepperoni</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The pineapples have it</strong>.</p>

      <p>The pepperoni-lover is outnumbered, and the extreme, divisive candidate is elected, even though there was a clear solution where everyone would be happy. No one was allowed to mention their second choice, so <strong>that information was lost</strong>. The vote counters had no way to know that everyone would be happy with pepperoni.</p>

      <p>In reality it's often even worse. In most of our elections, the winner ends up with <strong>less than 50%</strong> of the vote. That's like having 4 people out of 10 forcing the rest to eat a weird pineapple pizza. Even if you like pineapple pizza, you have to admit that's kinda rude.</p>

    <h2>The Problems with Plurality</h2>

    <p>In our elections we use a voting system called <strong>Plurality Voting</strong>. Because of that, we usually only see one Democrat and one Republican on the ballot. Sometimes that's fine because we like one of them. But what if we don't? For example, what if both candidates of the major parties had <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/31/poll-clinton-trump-most-unfavorable-candidates-ever/89644296/"><strong>"unfavorable" ratings of about 60%</strong></a>?</p>

    <p><strong>40% of Americans identify as "Independent" or a third party</strong> like Green or Libertarian. That's compared to 27% Republican and 32% Democrat. The non-Democrat, non-Republicans <strong>easily outnumber the Democrats or the Republicans</strong>, but they have virtually no representation in our government. Most of these people vote for Democrats or Republicans in every election, because to vote for an independent or third party would be to <strong>waste your vote</strong> or cause your "enemy" to win by <strong>splitting the vote</strong>.</p>

    <p>To return briefly to the pizza election analogy:</p>

    <p><strong>Vote splitting</strong> happens when Cheese Pizza runs against Extra-Cheese Pizza, and each get part of the Cheese-loving vote, causing both to lose (say each gets 25%, and the competitor gets the other 50%). This is the reason there are never two candidates in the same party, and you can't vote for the Libertarian if you're right-leaning nor the Green if you're left-leaning. You'd split the "right" or "left" vote, respectively, causing your "side" to lose.</p>
    <p><strong>Vote wasting</strong> is when you vote for Mushroom Pizza, even though you know everybody hates mushrooms. Your <strong>vote will not count</strong> because you already know that mushroom won't win. Many people in this situation "dishonestly" vote for one of the frontrunners instead because they want their vote to count, though some decide to waste their vote "on principle."</p>
    <p><strong>Extremist candidates</strong> often get elected under Plurality. We saw this with the Pineapple Pizza, which some loved and some hated. The centrist (pepperoni) which everybody likes fell victim to the <a target="_blank" href="https://electology.org/center-squeeze-effect">center squeeze effect</a></p>

      <h2>Approval Voting</h2>

      <p>Luckily, there is a very simple way to fix those problems. It's called "Approval Voting," and you already intuitively do it in your head every day. Let's go back to the three people ordering pizza. How could we hold an <strong>election that would select pepperoni?</strong></p>

      <p>Easy, ask everyone for all the kinds of pizza they like, and then figure out the consensus. Three people (all of them) like pepperoni, two people like pineapple, and one person likes cheese. Three is more than two or one, so pepperoni wins. Pepperoni is the consensus.</p>

      <p><strong>Approval Voting</strong> works exactly the same as our current elections, with one <strong>simple but crucial difference</strong>: you are allowed to <strong>vote for all the candidates you like</strong>, instead of just one. Most votes still wins. This seems crazy, I know. But it has wide-ranging and historic consequences:</p>

      <p>Under Approval Voting:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Voters get more choice</strong> because any and all candidates can run without worrying about vote splitting or "spoiling" each other.</li>
        <li><strong>You can always vote for your true favorite</strong> candidate without worrying about wasting your vote.</li>
        <li>You can <strong>also vote for a frontrunner if your candidate is unlikely to win</strong>, eliminating vote-splitting and giving you more voting power.</li>
        <li>Independent and third party candidates get an <strong>accurate measure</strong> of how many people actually prefer them, instead of a measure of how many people are willing to waste their vote "on principle".</li>
        <li>We are more likely to elect moderate, <strong>consensus candidates</strong> rather than allowing a minority to elect an extreme candidate.</li>
        <li>You can <strong>vote for issues instead of parties</strong>. For example, you could vote for all the candidates who agree with you on your most passionate issue, regardless of party affiliation.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>A Call to Action</h2>

    <p><strong>Plurality Voting has to end</strong>. It is a failure of Democracy, and we have better ways now. America is supposed to be the <strong>greatest nation in the world</strong>. We put a man on the moon. We invented the transistor and the internet. We are using <strong>the absolute worst voting system</strong> for all of our elections. Really! According to a vote of voting systems by a bunch of PhD voting theory experts at the London School of Economics and Political Science, our Plurality system ranks <strong>dead last</strong>.</p>

    <p>We can fix this. Mathematicians have known about this problem and the solutions for years, and finally, across the country Americans are waking up.</p>

    <p>It's simple: <strong>Vote for as many as you like. The most liked candidate wins</strong>.</p>

    <h2>The Colorado Movement</h2>

    <p><strong>Here in Colorado, there is already a small but growing movement to replace Plurality Voting with Approval Voting.</strong></p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.singerforcolorado.com/">Representative Jonathan Singer</a> will be introducing a bill into the <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/">Colorado General Assembly</a> in January which will <strong>allow Coloradans to use Approval Voting in local elections</strong>. It doesn't force anyone to do anything, it just sets standard rules for Approval Voting that any city can decide use if they want to.</p>

    <p>The next step after that will be to start bringing Approval Voting to our cities, with the eventual goal of making it a state-wide policy.</p>
